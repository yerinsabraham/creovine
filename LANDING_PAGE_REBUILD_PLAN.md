# Landing Page Rebuild Plan

## Core Message to Communicate
- Real code (not no-code) = Future-proof + Full ownership
- Vibe coding with AI + experts = Impossible speed
- Days not months = Speed that sounds unbelievable
- You own everything = GitHub repos, not platform lock-in

## Chosen Hero Headline
**"Real Code. Vibe Speed."**

Subheadline: "We Build Apps in 3-5 Days Using AI-Enhanced Development. You Get Full Source Code, GitHub Access, and Complete Ownership. Forever."

Tagline: "No templates. No no-code. No vendor lock-in. Just your app, built fast."

| ❌ Export issues | ✅ Deploy anywhere |

**Table 2: Traditional Devs vs Creovine**
| Traditional Devs | Creovine |
|------------------|----------|
